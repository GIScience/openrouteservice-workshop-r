[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GIScience/openrouteservice-workshop-r/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)


This repository provides R markdown files and sample data to help you learn how to use openrouteservice, a powerful routing service, directly from R. The scenarios covered in this repository focus on disaster aware routing, specifically dealing with flood-damaged infrastructure. By working through the provided R markdown files, you'll gain hands-on experience in requesting routes, analyzing travel time differences, and visualizing the results. The accompanying sample data allows you to explore real-world scenarios in the Ahr Valley area affected by a flood. Whether you're an R enthusiast or a data professional looking to enhance your routing analysis skills, this repository is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively utilize openrouteservice within the R environment. Get started today and unlock the potential of disaster aware routing using openrouteservice and R!
